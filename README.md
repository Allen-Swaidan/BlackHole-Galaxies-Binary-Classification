CNN using the keras sequential model on a dataset of black hole and galaxy images. An accuracy of 85% was achieved using this model. A prediction score closer to zero indicates that the model predicts that the image should be a black hole while a score closer to 1 indicates that the model predicts the image should be a galaxy
